This is a java project using Convolutional Neutral Network to classify the sentiment of a comment sentence. The idea and implements are
mostly similar with that of Kim's paper in EMNLP 2014. 
However, there are some slight changes between mine and Kim's. Please see the code for details.
The data are the same as those of Kim's paper which are provided by Pang and Lee in ACL 2005.
In the current configuration, the accuracy can achieve 73% approximately.
